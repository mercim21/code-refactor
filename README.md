# code-refactor
I had a very hard time trying to figure out how to "clean up the code" without keeping some of the "div's" in place. I also realized that I had pushed my changes several times without success throught the day and after getting assitance from someone on slack I was able to push the changes accordingly. After much reading and understanding a little better, the website and it's changes do not reflect the final outcome, but I will like to explain what I did. 

I used the nav code to help with the liknk and even though I got it to somewhat look like the requested image.I had a hard time getting it to stay in the center with padding. When I had requested for a second person to help on slack he asked that I start allover again and not to use the nav code. 

At this point I had gone back to start from scratch closer to the due time. I then looked up different codes online to help me get somewhere closer. I made a mistake by taking away every single "div" without realizing what it would do and how I could recuperate the function.

I tried different codes to figure out their functions and ran out of time and had to do one last push and submit my work. 

I'm still learning how to communicate between the html and css. However I was able to get some help and realized that the css has to match the commands in the css style code. 

I still haven't gotten the images to stay within their frames, but did see that the article and the semantic used in one has to be reflected in the other.
